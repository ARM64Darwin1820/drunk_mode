Note: This source code was publicly available but the repository returns a 404 error when trying to access it. I got the source code from the Reddit user /u/Chrisnba24 who compiled it for ARM64e and made it compatible with iOS 13. All credits for the working tweak go to him! I am only working on WhatsApp support, and maybe support for other IM apps once I'm happy with the WhatsApp support.
